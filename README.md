# ML Interview Questions & Answers

Welcome to the repository that serves as a comprehensive guide for Machine Learning (ML) Engineer job interviews, 
with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). Here, you'll find detailed discussions and examples based on recent 
interview questions and topics I've encountered.

## Topics Covered
The repository is organized into several main sections, each dedicated to a specific aspect of LLMs:

1. LLMs
 - **Metrics**: Learn about the different metrics used to evaluate the performance of LLMs, including examples of how to calculate and interpret these metrics.
 - **Quantization**: Explore the techniques and benefits of model quantization as a means to reduce model size and accelerate inference, complete with code examples.
 - **Fine-tuning**: Understand the processes and best practices for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks or datasets, including practical implementation guides.

## Repository Structure
 - **LLMs/metrics**: Contains scripts and notebooks detailing how to measure and interpret the performance of LLMs using various metrics.
 - **LLMs/quantization**: Includes examples and tutorials on how to apply quantization techniques to LLMs to optimize performance and efficiency.
 - **LLMs/fine_tuning**: Provides resources and guides for fine-tuning LLMs, including example code and detailed explanations.
